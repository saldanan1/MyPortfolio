Divergent Transformations and Ad Nauseam are the one-card win conditions with wheel synergies and Consultation lines as backup. This deck is most successful when there is another disruptive deck in the pod. It has game against the faster decks in the format thanks to powerful hate pieces like Rest In Peace, Cursed Totem, and Suppression Field.",

Itâs a primarily disruptive deck that does best in a meta where blood moon and null rod are powerful stax pieces, especially when it can lean on other disruptive decks for stack based interaction.",

  "_description": "The deck revolves around Ral Storm Conduit and spells like Chain of Smog and Chain Stasis. It also has a Jace Oracle and Consultation package. The deck is very adaptive, winning through both lines about evenly. It can win through many stax pieces, but dies when it can't tutor. The deck falls behind when it can't find needed colors, and it often has a difficult time recovering if things get destroyed. The deck's greatest strength is it flies under the radar until it wins.",
