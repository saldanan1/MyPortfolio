        My fox sparky was adopted when he was just 2 weeks old. He was abandonded by his mother and was left in our care.
        As a former zoo keeper, I knew what I had to do. We've been raising him for the last 3 years in the hopes of releasing
        him to the wild. That day has finally come... I'll miss you sparky. Here is the last photo of him, looking back at us
        as we left him for the last time.

        EDIT: WOW! Did not expect this many likes, thanks so much! Obligatory first gold!! I love my fox,

          people out there with fox problems too.

          <li>I hate foxes... this is such a dumb post, how did this make it so far up on the front page? Foxes are stupid and so is
            OP.
